# Student Dashboard Project

This project features a Student Dashboard that allows a user view greater detail on individual students when "Show More..." is clicked on. 

A user also has the ability to add a comment to a students car when "1-on-1 Notes" is clicked on and form provided is filled out & submitted.

When a user selects a unique cohort from cohort list to left of webpage, the Student list changes to a unique list of all students in that specific cohort. Total Students number is also updated when unique cohort is clicked on.

## Stretch Goals

Implemented a feature that changes colors of certain text and items when hovered over.
