##### The Student Dashboard Project
___
This website serves as a proof of concept to keep track of student progress as well as educator notes on each individual student. This website keeps track on a series of requirements for each individual student that you can see and then add notes on as a commentor. Afterwards, one can see the amount of comments made on each individual student.

Students can be sorted by Seasonal Start date or viewing all at once. 

A Day/Night bode can be toggled between for night time viewing.

# How to use

   To select a cohort, click on one of the Start Dates on the left hand side of the screen. By default, `All Students` is already selected.

   Click on `Show Details` to show the individual information on that given student. This includes scores and comments from instructors.

   - Code Wars 
      - Current Total
      - Last Week
      - Goal
      - Percent of Goal Achieved
   - Scores
      - Assignment score
      - Procjet Score
      - Assessment Score
   - Certifications
      - Resume
      - Linkedin
      - Mock Interview
      - Github

If these all meet the requirements (All certifications, all scores above 70%, & Codewars > 600) that student is marked as ```On Track for Graduation```

## 1-on-1 Notes

   This section will allow for instructors to share notes on given students. This form requires `Commentor Name` and a `Comment`. 
   - Failing to do so will result in the comment not being submitted.

   Below will have a list of all previous comments (if any). You can also find a total count of comments made on this student below the title.


## Stretch Goals

- Implemented a button to toggle between light and dark mode.
- Implememented a count for the number of notes added to each student (individually).
